# MITRE ATT&CK Framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a globally accessible knowledge base that provides a comprehensive matrix of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. It is widely used in cybersecurity for threat modeling, detection engineering, and adversary emulation.

---

## Why Use the MITRE ATT&CK Framework?

The framework helps organizations:
1. Understand attacker behavior.
2. Map attack simulations (e.g., red teaming) to known tactics and techniques.
3. Identify detection and response gaps in their defenses.
4. Enhance incident response and threat hunting strategies.

## Structure of the Framework

### 1. **Tactics**
Tactics represent the "why" of an attack—an adversary’s goal at each step. Examples include:
- **Initial Access**: How attackers gain entry to a system.
- **Persistence**: Methods used to maintain access to a compromised system.
- **Exfiltration**: Techniques used to steal data.

### 2. **Techniques**
Techniques are the "how"—specific methods attackers use to achieve their objectives. For example:
- **T1053.005**: Scheduled Tasks.
- **T1574.001**: DLL Search Order Hijacking.

### 3. **Sub-Techniques**
Sub-techniques provide additional granularity to describe specific variations of a technique. For example:
- **T1053.005**: Scheduled Task/Job (Windows Task Scheduler).

### 4. **Data Sources**
Data sources identify logs or telemetry that can help detect the use of specific techniques. Examples:
- Process execution logs.
- Registry changes.
- Network activity.

## Applications of MITRE ATT&CK in Purple Teaming

Purple Teaming leverages the framework to:
1. **Simulate Real-World TTPs**: Tools like Atomic Red Team, Caldera, and Prelude Operator use ATT&CK techniques to emulate adversary behavior.
2. **Test Detection Capabilities**: Map defensive tools to ATT&CK techniques to ensure robust coverage.
3. **Improve Collaboration**: Use ATT&CK as a shared language between Red and Blue Teams.

## Example Mapping: Persistence Techniques

Here’s how persistence techniques align with MITRE ATT&CK:

| Technique ID  | Name                                 | Description                                   |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **T1053.005** | Scheduled Task/Job                  | Use of task scheduler to maintain persistence.|
| **T1547.001** | Registry Run Keys/Startup Folder    | Modify registry or startup folder for persistence. |
| **T1543.003** | Service Creation                    | Create malicious services to execute payloads. |
| **T1574.001** | DLL Search Order Hijacking          | Hijack DLL loading by placing malicious DLLs. |

## Tools That Map to ATT&CK

1. **Atomic Red Team**: Simulates specific techniques with simple commands.
2. **Caldera**: Automates multi-step adversary emulation.
3. **Prelude Operator**: Focuses on continuous security validation using ATT&CK techniques.

## How to Use MITRE ATT&CK in Your Environment

1. **Perform Gap Analysis**: Identify which techniques are currently detected by your tools.
2. **Simulate Attacks**: Use tools like Atomic Red Team or Caldera to test your defenses against ATT&CK techniques.
3. **Develop Alerts**: Create SIEM rules or EDR policies based on ATT&CK mappings.
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update your detection and response based on new techniques added to ATT&CK.
